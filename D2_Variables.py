Variables:
    Variables store data in a computer memory.Mnemonic variables are recommended to use in many programming languages. A mnemonic variable is a variable name that can 
    be easily remembered and associated. A variable refers to a 
    memory address in which data is stored. Number at the beginning, special character, hypen are not allowed when naming a variable. A variabll can have a short name like x, y, z
    but a more descriptive name such as firstname, lastname is
    highly recommended.
